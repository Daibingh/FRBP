%[Algorithms]%
The matlab codes provided here implement two algorithms presented in the 
paper "MPCA_TNN08Jan.pdf" included in this package:

	Haiping Lu, K.N. Plataniotis, and A.N. Venetsanopoulos, 
	"MPCA: Multilinear Principal Component Analysis of Tensor Objects", 
	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 
	Vol. 19, No. 1, Page: 18-39, January 2008.

Algorithm 1: "MPCA.m" implements the MPCA algorithm described in this paper
Algorithm 2: "MPCALDA.m" implements the MPCA+LDA algorithm in this paper


%[Usages]%
Please refer to the comments in the codes, which include example usage on 
2D data and 3D data below:

FERETC80A45.mat: 320 faces (32x32) of 80 subjects (4 samples per class) from 
		 the FERET database
USF17Gal.mat:    731 gait samples (32x22x10) of 71 subjects from the gallery 
		 set of the USF gait challenge data sets version 1.7


%[Restriction]%
In all documents and papers reporting research work that uses the matlab codes 
provided here, the respective author(s) must reference the following paper:
